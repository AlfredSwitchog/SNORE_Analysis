multiframe DICOM files. Feedback about problems would be appreciated - particularly if you can
give us examples of problematic data (providing there are no subject confidentiality issues).


"/gpfs/gpfs1/scratch/c7201319/SNORE_MR/16/Night/MR ep2d_bold_samba_2mm_sleep/MR003174.dcm" appears to be multi-frame DICOM.
Converting these data is still experimental and has only been tested on a very small number of
multiframe DICOM files. Feedback about problems would be appreciated - particularly if you can
give us examples of problematic data (providing there are no subject confidentiality issues).

Conversion completed. NIfTI files saved in folder: /scratch/c7201319/SNORE_MR_out/16/nifti_raw
